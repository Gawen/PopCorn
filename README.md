# "PopCorn" and "WaterQuest"

PopCorn was a tentative of 3D game engine I started back in 2004. The goal was
to use it for a video game we were building with some friends called
[WaterQuest](https://github.com/Gawen/life/commit/048df167340cdf8ff72c5db3197946b610e2db02).
Both projects never finished.

PopCorn is based on OpenGL 1.2 or 1.4, OpenAL, OpenDE and SDL. I restarted this
project from scratch many times, as I was never happy about the architectures I
built. This repository contains the latest version, which I think dates around
the 2nd of September 2004.

PopCorn was a great sandbox for me where I learned C++ and its 1001 styles ;-),
OOP, OpenGL (shaders did not exist back then), what is a good and bad
architecture design, how to deal with perfectionism when coding (still learning
about that), ...

There's nothing amazing here, but this code has a sentimental value for me.
After thinking I lost the code for ever, I stumbled upon this backup in an old
hard-drive found in a dark cavern. I was overwhelmed and decided to publish it
to never loose it again.

And also to respect the will of past-me, which probably wanted to publish my
code on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popcorn3d/), but never
could as I did not understand how to use Subversion.
